                Implementing data mesh is nontrivial and highly dependent on the organization.
                Here, we capture real world learnings based on observations and experiences, so you might be able to get something out of it for your own data mesh journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want this collection of real world learnings to be a <strong>community effort</strong>. Please share your observations and learnings <a href="https://www.datamesh-architecture.com/#authors">with us</a> so we can put them up here for you, or <a href="https://github.com/datamesh-architecture/datamesh-architecture.com/edit/main/real-world-learnings.html">add them yourself via a pull request yourself</a>.

                    We were surprised, how much additional know how we had to learn, particularly for performance and cost optimization:
                    How to efficiently transfer data from Kafka to S3?
                    Single events that we have in production got expensive and took too long to process.
                    Building batches increased latency and led to inconsistencies.
                    JSON as storage format took too much space and costs, so we had to learn Parquet.
                    With Athena, every query is billed and needs to be considered, e.g., when defining regular data quality checks.
